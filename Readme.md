This was a mini project we had to complete for the Engineering Principles Module using the MBot.
Our bot was tasked to navigate through a walled maze, making precised turn routines based on the colour detected at each turn.
Our bot was further tasked to avoid all wall collisons using an IR Sensor.
Each turn will be identified through a black strip on the floor of the maze.
The bot was also tasked to play a victory music at the end of the maze.
